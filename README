Add authengine to your Gemfile:
      gem 'authengine'
      gem 'haml'

And run:
      bundle install

In config/application.rb, configure the generator for haml by including:
    config.generators do |g|
    # Configure haml to be the default templating engine for generators
      g.template_engine :haml
    end

Then copy the authengine migrations and initializer to your application
and modify your application.html.rb to use the authengine with:
      rails generate authengine

The database is initialized with the default username: admin and password: password
be sure to delete this user once the real administrator has been created.

When logged in, the preconfigured admin user is assigned to the 'developer' role,
which grants permissions to all controllers and actions. Additional users, roles and
permissions may then be granted.
